# ACT tool chain (https://github.com/asyncvlsi), as a drop in binary package with out filesystem path dependence and without library dependencies (almost no)

it was verified to be working out of the box on the following systems:
 - CentOS/RHEL/Oracle Linux 7.2+
 - RHEL/RockyLinux/AlmaLinux/Orecle Linux 8
 - Debian 9/10/11
 - Ubuntu 16.04/18.04/20.04/22.04
 - OpenSUSE 15
 - ArchLinux
 - Fedora 20/latest

should also work on other systems with kernel 3.10+ (libc version) and GNU linker ld or compatible, like BSD OSes (but not tested).

## install

just set in your shell (this is for bash, setenv works eqiv.)
```
export ACT_HOME=<path to extracted folder>
export PATH=${ACT_HOME}/bin:${PATH}
```
or execute in the folder you extracted the tar in, so the folder that than has a single new folder called act after extraction!
```
export ACT_HOME=$(pwd)/act
export PATH=${ACT_HOME}/bin:${PATH}
```

and start working with it!

the async memory compiler you can find in $ACT_HOME/amc
